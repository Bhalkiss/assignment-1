                     <p>My name is Balikis,i am a fashion designer whose passion is reading, 
                    i started my tertiary education at yaba college of technology where i studied  computer science, 
                    we started coding with pen and paper which is not really interesting,
                    fortunately for me i was able to get my first lap top which led me into this beautiful world of 
                    technology, i learnt the few  things i could learn from school and i learnt most of my skills with youtube videos,
                    i am a curious person who is always willing to learn and as my favorite quote by Abigail Adam goes "learning is not attained
                    by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to by dilligence".
                    i am currently a frontend engineering student at Altschool africa and to be very honest, i cant wait to meet the best version of myself at the end of this program
